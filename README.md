# Customer Churn Prediction & Analysis System
Customer churn analysis with EDA, feature engineering, and ML models

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn refers to customers leaving a service.  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn and analyzing key factors
associated with customer loss using machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict whether a customer will churn
- Analyze and interpret factors influencing churn
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate classification metrics


## 🧠 Project Status
Project completed up to model evaluation and interpretation.
The scope of this project is focused on data analysis, feature engineering,
model building, and performance evaluation for customer churn prediction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack 
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Phases
- Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Planning ✅
- Phase 2: Data Analysis & Understanding ✅
- Phase 3: Data Cleaning & EDA ✅
- Phase 4: Feature Engineering ✅

## 📌 Project Scope & Limitations

- The project focuses on predictive modeling and evaluation of customer churn
- Business decision-making, retention cost modeling, and ROI simulation
  are intentionally excluded
- Results are intended to support analytical understanding rather than
  direct business deployment


## 📊 Key Insights

- Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit higher churn rates
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn likelihood
- Longer customer tenure correlates with reduced churn probability
